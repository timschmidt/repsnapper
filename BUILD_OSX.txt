THIS DOCUMENT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS - SEE also : https://github.com/timschmidt/repsnapper/issues/38

get a few dependancies first:

lf you don't already have homebrew installed from http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/, do it:
#EITHER:
# this puts it in /usr/local
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/323731)"
# OR:
# this puts it in /opt/homebrew 
cd /opt ; sudo mkdir homebrew && curl -L https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/tarball/master | sudo tar xz --strip 1 -C homebrew

make sure the 'brew' command is in your path, also put /usr/local  there too, for autoconf/libtool/make as per below:
set PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH

# now we have brew, install as many of these as you can get to work, you may need to remove pkg-config and/or libiconv from this list if its broken when you try it?
brew install gtkmm gtk+ gtkglext cmake glib glade pkg-config pcre pkg-config intltool gettext libiconv

you'll also need to manually download , compile and install the latest versions of libtool, autoconf and make:

these above tools are ( by default) installed into /usr/local, so you need to have /usr/local/bin in your PATH variable, before /usr/bin etc:
( extract each of these to a folder, cd to it, type: ./configure ; make ; sudo make install )

cd ~
wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf/autoconf-2.68.tar.gz
tar -zxvpf autoconf-2.68.tar.gz
cd autoconf-2.68
./configure ; make 
sudo make install
cd ~
wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libtool/libtool-2.4.tar.gz
cd libtool-2.4
./configure ; make 
sudo make install
cd ~
wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/make-3.82.tar.gz
cd make-3.82
./configure ; make
sudo make install
cd ~



# if libiconv from brew is still broken when you try this,  then do this instead:
cd ~
wget http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/libiconv/libiconv-1.14.tar.gz
tar -zxvpg libiconv-1.14.tar.gz
cd libiconv-1.14
#( this builds both 32 and 64 bit archithecture , if you are building for just one architecture, remove one of the -arch XXX types ) 
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.6 \
CFLAGS='-O3 -fno-common -arch i386 -arch x86_64' \
LDFLAGS='-O3 -arch i386 -arch x86_64' \
CXXFLAGS='-O3 -fno-common -arch i386 -arch x86_64' \
./configure --prefix=/usr/local


# make sure you have the latest repsnapper sources from GIT , as OSX features are recent
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:timschmidt/repsnapper.git
cd repsnapper

# make /usr/local/aclocal aware of the homebrew installed stuff:
cat > /usr/local/share/aclocal/dirlist << EOF
/opt/homebrew/share/aclocal/
EOF


./autogen.sh
make
