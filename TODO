--- the plan ---

* Move most of 'model.cpp' into a new 'view.cpp'

* Serial
	+ error dialogs - "failed to connect ?"
	+ /dev/ttyUSB0 - EACCES
		+ group / permissions problem.
		+ you need to tweak permissions, or add yourself
		  to XYZ group, and re-login ...

* Settings re-factor
	+ stop Model being a widget ...

* Finish the 'Display' settings page
* add Hardware Settings profiles:
	+ "Mendel", "XYZ", "etc." ? :-)

* do settings work ...
	* auto-connect settings to the UI
	* finish the settings we cannot do manually ...
		+ custom button foo ...
	+ another biig table of spin-button / range details etc.

* win32 osc build fun ...

--- misc stuff ---

* make toolkit lock sane and truly recursive
	+ to avoid gdk threads deadlock[!]

* serial
	+ move ModelViewController DetectComPorts to RepRapSerial ...
	  ditto ValidateComPort

* connection button
	+ should require confirmation before going off-line
	  during a print ... [ and/or 'pause printing' ]

* serial connection
	* add a test serial connection ...

* RFO re-work
	+ class name fixing: RFO_File etc.
	+ encapsulate the selection concept in a clean abstract object
	+ re-work RFO storage to use pointers not vectors with instances

* add click-to-select in the 3D view

* re-factor MVC
	* rename view.cpp etc. to render.cpp
		* include SpinRows in view.cpp ...
	* split chunks of model.cpp to view.cpp etc.
		* split out / create an 'RFOView' widget to (sanely)
		  manipulate that treeview

* bug fixing:
	+ arcball / rotation resetting ...
	+ re-instate a non-gui mode ...

* add log scrolling:
	+ gtk_text_view_scroll_to_iter [etc.]
	+ when the adjustments change etc.
